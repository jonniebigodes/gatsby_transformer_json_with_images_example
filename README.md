# Simple implementation of how to use gatsby-transfomer-json with images

It implements on how to fetch data from the plugin and fetch the images(responsive) and show them together.

First approach is simple and straightforward based on a page query and es6/js manipulation.

Second approach by extending the transformer-json node that is created and injects the image data to a new field in the node making it available out of the box and will avoid es6/javascript manipulation.
